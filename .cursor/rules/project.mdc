# Project Rules

## Code Quality

- Always run `./maintain.sh` before committing to ensure code quality.

## Documentation

- Update documentation (README.md, .cursor/rules/*.mdc) when you change functionality or add new features.

## Language

- Use only English for all code, comments, docstrings, documentation, commit messages, and project artifacts.
- Communicate with users in Russian, but all technical content must be in English.
- Do not use emoji in logs, console output, or any code output.
- Use sentence case for titles and headings (first word capitalized, rest lowercase unless proper nouns).
